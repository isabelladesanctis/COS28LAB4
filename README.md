# COS285LAB4

Sophia Priola,
Caelin Limerick,
Isabella DeSanctis,
Josie Colton

The lab went well. Caelin and Isabella worked primarily on part 2, where Sophia worked on part 3 and Caelin worked more on part 4. It was a colaborative effort and the methods were ones we had seen in the past. 

How to run code: From your project folder in a terminal, compile then run the class that has the main (Lab4.java).
